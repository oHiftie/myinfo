                <h2>About me <br> <span>Becoming a "Software Developer" was my dream since i was in 2nd standard. I always used to think "How i can create my own Website?" I still remember when i was in 4th standard, my teacher asked about my dream. Obviously my answer was "becoming a Software Developer" But, my teacher answered with really heavy words "being a software developer is useless, it don't have any scope. You should become Doctor or engineer" many others came and demotivated me. After those things that happened to me i started feeling shy to tell anyone that my dream is to become a Software Developer. In 6th standard my father was checking my youtube history, It was full of those things in which i was interested in. obviously things regarding Software Development. My father figured out that i was hiding something inside myself. He talked to me that night and i somehow expressed my dream towards him and my Father actually supported me. He Gifted me a brand new pc for programming. In 7th standard i started learning 'Pyhthon' but i messed up that time. Basically i quitted and i randomly started learning discord.js without learning javascript and i messed up again. But then a person named WhiteToggled motivated me and suggested me to learn HTMl and css and Finally i was able to create this website. </span></h2>
